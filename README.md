# My-Library-Project

This is a simple web-based library management application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It allows users to:

- Add new books with title, author, and publication year.  
- Display all books in a clean table layout.  
- Search for books by title, author, or year.  
- Delete books directly from the table.  

The project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic updates using JavaScript.  
The interface is styled with CSS for a clean and user-friendly experience.
